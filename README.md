# Home-Server
Repo will contain what i have in/on my home server (steps and docker-compose files).



## Set up home server first
1. First need to install Ubuntu Server LTS version from here: https://ubuntu.com/download/server
     - Remember to **uncheck** "Set up this drive as an LVM group" else it will partition your drive into many partitions.
     - You also need to reverse a static IP address (internal: meaning on your home network and not with your ISP or whatever) for your home server to make accessing it later on much easier (optional). Using this YT video as a reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuRWqzfX1ik
2. Once that's done or when going through the installation process, install ***docker*** and ***docker-compose*** or check steps later down where to install docker if it was not installed during installation of ubuntu server.
3. Once installation is completed, you can then SSH into the server by opening a command prompt and typing:<br/>
   `ssh <your-username>@<your-ip-address>`
4. Then, the first thing to do is disabling your sleep, suspend, hibernate functions on the server so it stays always on.
   - From this article: https://linux-tips.us/how-to-disable-sleep-and-hibernation-on-ubuntu-server/, run the commands:<br/>
     `sudo systemctl mask sleep.target`<br/>
     `sudo systemctl mask suspend.target`<br/>
     `sudo systemctl mask hibernate.target`<br/>
     `sudo systemctl mask hybrid-sleep.target`<br/>
   - For laptops, run this command:<br/>
     `sudo nano /etc/systemd/logind.conf` Make sure to have `nano` installed first, it is a text editing application or use something else you are familiar with.<br/>
     Then, uncomment the following lines: `HandleSuspendKey`, `HandleLidSwitch`, `HandleLidSwitchDocked` and change their values to `ignore`. Save the file and exit the file.



## Setting up services
Below will be the services installation procedures for the home server.


### SMB / Samba
Following the YT tutorial mentioned above: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuRWqzfX1ik <br/>
- On your server, install the SMB daemon with the following command: <br/>
`sudo apt install samba` <br/>
- Once thatâ€™s completed, you need a directory to store the files you will be sharing on the network. You may choose to create a folder in the `/home/$USER/shared` (replace $USER with your username) directory using the command: <br/>
`sudo mkdir /home/$USER/shared` <br/>
- Since this folder will likely be accessed by other utilities, like Jellyfin, it is best to give your user all permissions to avoid issues later on using the command: <br/>
`sudo chown $USER: /home/$USER/shared` <br/>
- Configuring Samba:
  - Edit it with `sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf` <br/>
  - Change the line `map to guest = bad user` to `map to guest = never` <br/>
  - Add the folder you just created to the shares by adding these lines at the end of the file: <br/>
       `[shared]` <br/>
       `path = /home/$USER/shared` <br/>
       `writeable=yes` <br/>
       `public=no` <br/>
  - Save file by pressing Ctrl + X and then Y then Enter
  - Run `sudo smbpasswd -a youruser` ("youruser" needs to be replaced with your username) and set a password for samba
  - Restart Samba with : `sudo systemctl restart smbd`
  - Next, follow the steps in this guide to setup your shared storage on Windows, Mac: https://chriskalos.notion.site/5d5ff30f9bdd4dfbb9ce68f0d914f1f6?pvs=25
